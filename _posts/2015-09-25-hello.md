yup, i just made a simple blog, where i could write my thoughts about programming, and it in general.

i was just making a simple 3d game in D language, using OpenGL 3. currently it has a simple shader + material loading 'library'. it will be a railshooter kindof thing, think of SWTOR space mission but with a neon-style graphics.

the basic glow shader is looking reaaaaaly nice, so I'm optimistic.

let's see where it goes.
